Introduction
============
This is my Dotefile project. I saved these files on Github just for myself, but of course I do not forbid to use it or snatch ideas from it.

My Dotefiles contains a quite complex vim configuration, my favorite Linux programmes, a few helper scripts and a simple zsh configuration.

Startup
=======
Run the following commands to configure all automatically:

    git clone https://github.com/aufgang001/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    ~/.dotfiles/bootstrap.sh
