Introduction
============
This is my Dotefile project. I saved these files on Github just for myself, but of course I do not forbid to use it or snatch ideas from it.

My Dotefiles contain a quite complex vim configuration, my favorite Linux programmes, a few helper scripts, and a simple zsh configuration.


Requirements
============
Git:
    
    sudo apt-get install git    


Distribution specific configuration
===================================
[Ubuntu](ubuntu/README.md)


Startup
=======
Run the following commands to configure all automatically:

    git clone https://github.com/aufgang001/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    cd ~/.dotfiles
    ./bootstrap.sh


And reboot your system:

    sudo reboot
